      "llm_context": "Purpose in Document: This placeholder sets an upper limit on the company's valuation at which the SAFE will convert into equity during a future equity financing round. Use Case: It provides the investor with a guaranteed maximum valuation for their conversion, protecting them from excessive dilution if the company's valuation significantly increases before the next equity round. Questions to Ask User: What is the agreed-upon Post-Money Valuation Cap for this SAFE, in US Dollars? This cap defines the maximum valuation at which the investor's SAFE will convert into equity. Value Description: This represents a specific monetary valuation (in USD) that acts as a ceiling for the conversion price of the SAFE. Value Types: Currency (USD). Constraints/Ranges: Must be a positive numerical value, typically a significant round number, expressed in US Dollars. Examples: \"5,000,000.00\", \"10,000,000.00\", \"20,000,000.00\". Legal/Business Context: This is a critical financial and business term for the investor, as it can significantly impact their ownership percentage upon conversion. It is a key negotiation point between the company and the investor. The \"Safe Price\" and \"Liquidity Price\" (defined in Section 2) are directly calculated using this valuation cap. Related Fields: \"Purchase Amount\" (PLACEHOLDER_0003), \"Safe Price\", \"Liquidity Price\", \"Company Capitalization\", and \"Liquidity Capitalization\" are all related to the calculation of the investor's equity based on this cap. Validation Rules: Must be a valid currency format, a positive numerical value, and often a multiple of a hundred thousand or million dollars.",
