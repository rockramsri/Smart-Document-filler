      "llm_context": "Purpose in Document: This placeholder sets the 'Post-Money Valuation Cap,' which is a crucial term defining the maximum valuation at which the SAFE will convert into equity in a future financing round. Use Case: This field is filled during the negotiation of the SAFE terms between the company and the investor. It provides a ceiling on the company's valuation for the purpose of the investor's conversion, ensuring a certain minimum equity stake regardless of a significantly higher subsequent valuation. Questions to Ask User: What is the agreed-upon Post-Money Valuation Cap for this SAFE (in US Dollars)? Value Description: This represents a specific maximum monetary valuation placed on the company that will be used to calculate the conversion price for the SAFE, especially if the company's valuation in a subsequent equity financing exceeds this cap. Value Types: Currency (USD). Constraints/Ranges: The value must be a positive numerical amount, typically in US dollars, and is usually a round number (e.g., in millions). Examples: \"5,000,000\" (representing $5,000,000), \"10,000,000\" (representing $10,000,000), \"20,000,000\" (representing $20,000,000). Legal/Business Context: The Post-Money Valuation Cap is a key investor protection mechanism. It directly influences the 'Safe Price' and 'Liquidity Price' (as defined in Section 2) and determines how many shares the investor will receive upon conversion. It's a critical factor in the investor's potential return. Related Fields: [Purchase Amount], 'Safe Price', 'Liquidity Price', 'Company Capitalization', 'Liquidity Capitalization'. Validation Rules: The input must be a positive numerical value, typically formatted as currency, and should be a reasonable valuation for a startup at the stage of receiving SAFE investment.",
