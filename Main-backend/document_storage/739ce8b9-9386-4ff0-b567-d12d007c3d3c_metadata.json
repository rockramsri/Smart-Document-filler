Its purpose is to establish a maximum valuation at which the SAFE will convert into equity during a future 'Equity Financing' or 'Liquidity Event', providing protection and a guaranteed minimum ownership percentage for the investor. This field is typically filled during the negotiation and drafting phases of the SAFE, as it's a key deal term. The user should be asked: \"What is the agreed-upon Post-Money Valuation Cap for this SAFE?\" The value represents a specific monetary amount, usually in US Dollars, that caps the company's valuation for conversion purposes. The expected value type is currency (USD) or a number. It must be a positive numerical value, commonly a significant round number, entered without currency symbols but understood as USD. Examples include: \"5,000,000\", \"10,000,000\", \"25,000,000\". This cap is a fundamental economic safeguard for the investor, directly influencing the 'Safe Price' and 'Liquidity Price' calculations, which determine the conversion rate of the investor's 'Purchase Amount' into shares. It is related to the 'Purchase Amount', 'Safe Price', 'Liquidity Price', 'Company Capitalization', and 'Liquidity Capitalization'.
