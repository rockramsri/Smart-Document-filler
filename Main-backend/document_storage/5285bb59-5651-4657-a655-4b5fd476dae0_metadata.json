      "llm_context": "This placeholder defines the \"Post-Money Valuation Cap,\" a critical term in a SAFE that limits the valuation at which the investor's SAFE will convert into equity during an equity financing, to the investor's benefit. Its purpose is to set the maximum valuation for the SAFE conversion, protecting the investor from excessive dilution if the company's valuation significantly increases before conversion. This field must be filled as it's a fundamental economic term of the SAFE. To get the correct value, ask: \"What is the agreed-upon Post-Money Valuation Cap for this SAFE, in US Dollars?\" The value represents a specific monetary valuation (in US Dollars) that serves as an upper limit for the company's valuation when calculating the conversion price of the SAFE into equity. The expected value type is Currency (Number). It must be a positive numerical value, typically expressed in US Dollars, and usually formatted with or without two decimal places for cents. Examples include \"$5,000,000\", \"$10,000,000\", or \"$20,000,000.00\". This is a key economic term for the investor, directly influencing the number of shares the investor will receive upon conversion, with a lower cap generally being more favorable. It's fundamental to the SAFE's structure. This field relates to the \"Purchase Amount\", \"Company Capitalization\", \"Liquidity Capitalization\", \"Safe Price\", \"Liquidity Price\", and the \"Majority-in-interest\" definition for amendment purposes. Validation requires a positive number, formatted as currency (e.g., \"$X,XXX,XXX.XX\").",
