Questions to Ask User: What is the exact monetary amount (in U.S. Dollars) that the Investor is paying to the Company for this SAFE? Value Description: This represents the principal investment capital, expressed in U.S. currency, that the Investor contributes to the Company.

Typically, it should be formatted as a currency with a dollar sign and, if applicable, two decimal places for cents. Examples: \"$100,000.00\", \"$25,000\", \"$500,000.50\". Legal/Business Context: The 'Purchase Amount' is the core economic term of the SAFE. Its accuracy is paramount as it directly dictates the investor's future equity stake or cash payout. Any error here could significantly alter the financial outcome for both parties. Related Fields: The 'Purchase Amount' is a defined term used in Section 1(a) for Equity Financing conversion, Section 1(b) for Liquidity Event calculations (Cash-Out Amount and Conversion Amount), and Section 1(c) for Dissolution Events.

Value Description: This represents a predetermined maximum valuation (in U.S. Dollars) of the Company that will be used to calculate the conversion price of the SAFE into equity during an 'Equity Financing'. If the Company's actual post-money valuation at the time of conversion exceeds this cap, the Investor's SAFE will convert at a lower, more favorable price based on this cap, resulting in more shares for the Investor.

Examples: \"$10,000,000\", \"$5,000,000\", \"$15,000,000\". Legal/Business Context: The 'Post-Money Valuation Cap' is a key economic term in a SAFE, designed to protect early investors from excessive dilution if the company's valuation dramatically increases before their SAFE converts. It directly influences the 'Safe Price' and 'Liquidity Price' definitions (Section 2) which are crucial for conversion and exit calculations.
