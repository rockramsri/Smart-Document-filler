      "llm_context": "This placeholder defines the 'Post-Money Valuation Cap' for the SAFE. Its purpose is to set an upper limit on the company's valuation at which the SAFE will convert into equity in a future equity financing. This cap protects the investor by ensuring they receive a certain minimum ownership percentage, even if the company's valuation significantly increases before conversion. This field is crucial and highly negotiated, needing to be filled to establish a key economic term of the SAFE. When asking the user, inquire: 'What is the agreed-upon Post-Money Valuation Cap for this SAFE?' The value represents a monetary cap on the company's valuation used to calculate the conversion price. Expected data type is currency, specifically U.S. Dollars. It must be a positive numerical value, expressed as a currency amount, typically a whole number. Examples include \"$5,000,000\" or \"$10,000,000\". This cap directly impacts the 'Safe Price' and 'Liquidity Price' (defined in Section 2) and thus the number of shares the investor will receive upon conversion, making it a critical factor in the investor's potential return. It is related to PLACEHOLDER_0003 (Purchase Amount) and various definitions in Section 2. Validation should ensure it is a positive number, formatted as currency (e.g., \"$X,XXX,XXX\").",
