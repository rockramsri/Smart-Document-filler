Examples: \"$100,000\", \"$50,000.00\", \"$250,000\". Legal/Business Context: The Purchase Amount is fundamental to the SAFE agreement.

Related Fields: This field is directly related to PLACEHOLDER_0002 (Investor Name) and indirectly to PLACEHOLDER_0007 (Post-Money Valuation Cap), as both are crucial for determining the investor's future equity stake.

Use Case: This field is filled at the inception of the SAFE agreement to provide essential corporate identification information, particularly relevant for legal jurisdiction. Questions to Ask User: In which U.S. state is the company legally incorporated? Value Description: This represents the name of the U.S. state (e.g., Delaware, California) where the company has formally registered as a legal entity, as reflected in its certificate of incorporation or formation. Value Types: Text (State Name). Constraints/Ranges: Must be a valid and recognized U.S. state name. Examples: \"Delaware\", \"California\", \"New York\". Legal/Business Context: The state of incorporation is crucial as it determines the corporate law that governs the company's internal affairs, its legal structure, and often its ability to conduct business. It's a fundamental piece of corporate identity. Related Fields: This field is closely related to PLACEHOLDER_0001 and PLACEHOLDER_0005 (Company Name), as it specifies the jurisdiction of that entity. Validation Rules: The entered value must be a recognized U.S. state. It should match the company's official incorporation documents.",

Use Case: This field is a core economic term negotiated between the company and the investor. It is filled at the time the SAFE is issued to provide the investor with a measure of protection against excessive dilution. Questions to Ask User: What is the agreed-upon Post-Money Valuation Cap for this SAFE, expressed in U.S. Dollars? Value Description: This represents a ceiling on the company's valuation for the purpose of converting the SAFE into equity. If the company raises an equity round at a valuation higher than this cap, the SAFE converts at the cap, effectively giving the investor more shares for their money. Value Types: Currency (USD). Constraints/Ranges: Must be a positive numerical value, representing U.S. Dollars. It should typically be a significant whole dollar amount, formatted as currency (e.g., $10,000,000 or $10,000,000.00). Examples: \"$10,000,000\", \"$15,000,000.00\", \"$20,000,000\". Legal/Business Context: The Post-Money Valuation Cap is one of the most important economic terms for the investor, as it directly impacts the potential return and dilution. A lower cap is generally more favorable to the investor. This value is explicitly used in the definitions of \"Safe Price\" and \"Liquidity Price\" in Section 2, which are critical for calculating the investor's conversion rights. Related Fields: This field is critical in conjunction with PLACEHOLDER_0003 (Purchase Amount) for determining the investor's ultimate equity stake.
