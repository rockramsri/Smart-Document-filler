Its purpose is to protect the investor by ensuring they receive shares based on a maximum valuation, even if the company's actual valuation significantly increases before a conversion event. This is a key economic term for the investor's potential return. The user should be asked: 'What is the agreed-upon Post-Money Valuation Cap for this SAFE, in U.S. Dollars?' This placeholder represents a specific monetary valuation in U.S. Dollars that acts as a cap for the company's valuation during SAFE conversion. The expected value type is currency (US Dollar). It must be a positive numerical value, typically in whole dollars. Examples include '$5,000,000.00', '$10,000,000', or '$25,000,000'. This cap directly influences the 'Safe Price' and 'Liquidity Price' calculations, which determine the number of shares the investor receives. A lower cap is generally more favorable to the investor. This field is directly related to the 'Purchase Amount' (PLACEHOLDER_0003) and other valuation-related definitions like 'Company Capitalization' and 'Liquidity Capitalization'. Validation should ensure it is a valid currency amount, typically greater than zero and often substantially higher than the Purchase Amount.",
