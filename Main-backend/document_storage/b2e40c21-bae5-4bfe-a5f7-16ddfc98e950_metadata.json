This field is fundamental to the SAFE's economics and must be filled to define the investor's potential upside. The user should be asked: 'What is the agreed-upon Post-Money Valuation Cap for this SAFE, in US dollars?' The value represents a specific monetary ceiling on the company's valuation. The expected value type is currency, a positive numerical US dollar amount. It should be formatted with a dollar sign and typically represents a significant sum (e.g., '$5,000,000.00', '$10,000,000', '$15,000,000.00'). This valuation cap is a key deal term that directly impacts the 'Safe Price' and 'Liquidity Price' calculations, offering the investor a better conversion price if the company's valuation at the next equity round exceeds this cap. It is a critical factor in the investor's return. Validation requires it to be a positive number and a valid currency format, typically a round figure in millions.",
